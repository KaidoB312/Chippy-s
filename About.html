                    <p>Grandma Gertrude started baking cookies for her grandchildren in her small kitchen back in 1985. What began as a way to show love to her family soon turned into a neighborhood sensation as friends and neighbors began requesting her delicious creations.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 1990, with encouragement from her family, Gertrude opened her first small cookie shop. Her philosophy was simple: use only the finest ingredients, never cut corners, and put love into every batch. This approach resonated with customers, and her business grew steadily over the years.</p>

            <p>Today, Chippy's has three locations throughout the city, but we still operate by Gertrude's original principles. Though Gertrude herself retired in 2010, her recipes and baking techniques continue to be used by our dedicated team of bakers.</p>
            
            <p>At 85 years young, Gertrude still visits the shops regularly to ensure quality and occasionally share baking tips with our staff. Her favorite cookie remains the classic chocolate chip, though she admits to having a soft spot for the seasonal pumpkin spice cookies we offer each fall.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>To bring joy and comfort to our community through delicious, homemade cookies made with the same care and attention that Grandma Gertrude put into her very first batch.</p>
